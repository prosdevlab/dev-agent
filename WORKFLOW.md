# Development Workflow

Standard workflow for implementing features in dev-agent.

## 📚 Related Documentation

Before starting development, familiarize yourself with our coding standards:

- **[TypeScript Standards](./docs/TYPESCRIPT_STANDARDS.md)** ⭐ **START HERE** - Our coding manifesto
- **[Feature Template](./docs/FEATURE_TEMPLATE.md)** - Step-by-step guide for new features
- **[Architecture](./ARCHITECTURE.md)** - System design and package structure

## The Drill™

### 1. Find Next Work (Dogfooding! 🐕🍽️)

```bash
# Update main branch
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Use GitHub Context to find what to work on next
dev github search "state:open label:\"Epic: MCP Integration\"" --type issue

# Or use gh CLI directly
gh issue list --milestone "Epic #3: MCP Integration" --state open

# The tool helps you:
# - Find open issues by epic/milestone
# - See issue dependencies
# - Prioritize based on labels
# - Avoid duplicate work
```

### 2. Start New Feature

```bash
# Create feature branch (use feat/, fix/, docs/, etc.)
git checkout -b feat/feature-name

# Update TODOs (mark as in_progress)
# Done via todo_write tool in Claude
```

### 3. Planning Phase (Dogfooding! 🐕🍽️)

```bash
# Read the issue requirements
gh issue view <issue-number>

# Use the Planner to break down the work
dev plan <issue-number> --json

# Review the plan and adjust as needed
# The planner will:
# - Break issue into specific tasks
# - Find relevant code locations
# - Estimate effort
# - Suggest implementation order
```

**Why dogfood the Planner?**
- ✅ Tests our own tool in real scenarios
- ✅ Identifies bugs and missing features
- ✅ Improves estimation accuracy over time
- ✅ Validates usefulness for end users

### 4. Implementation Phase

```bash
# Design interfaces first (in comments or types)
# Implement with test-driven development
# Document with examples as you go
```

**Implementation Checklist:**
- [ ] Define types/interfaces
- [ ] Implement core functionality
- [ ] Write comprehensive tests
- [ ] Add usage examples
- [ ] Create README if new module
- [ ] Update related documentation

### 5. Quality Checks

```bash
# Build all packages
pnpm build

# Run all tests
pnpm test

# Check specific package coverage
npx vitest run packages/<package>/src/<module> --coverage

# Lint and format
pnpm lint
pnpm format

# Type check
pnpm typecheck
```

**Quality Standards:**
- ✅ All tests passing
- ✅ 85%+ statement coverage (aim for 90%+)
- ✅ 100% function coverage
- ✅ No linter errors
- ✅ No TypeScript errors
- ✅ **Follows [TypeScript Standards](./docs/TYPESCRIPT_STANDARDS.md)** (no `as`, Result types, pure functions)
- ✅ Documentation with examples

### 6. Commit & PR

```bash
# Stage all changes
git add -A

# Commit with conventional commit format
git commit -m "feat(<scope>): <description>

<detailed description>

Features:
- Feature 1
- Feature 2

Testing:
- X tests, all passing
- Y% coverage

<additional sections>

Issue: #<issue-number>"

# Push to remote
git push -u origin feat/feature-name

# Create PR with comprehensive description
gh pr create \
  --title "feat(<scope>): <title>" \
  --body "<detailed PR description>" \
  --base main
```

### 7. Changesets & Package Dependencies

**Important: Always create changesets for user-facing changes.**

```bash
# Create changeset for the changes
pnpm changeset

# Or create manually in .changeset/ directory
```

**Package Dependency Rules:**
- **CLI changes** (`@prosdevlab/dev-agent-cli`) → **ALWAYS bump `@prosdevlab/dev-agent`** (the main wrapper package)
- **Core changes** (`@prosdevlab/dev-agent-core`) → Usually bump CLI and wrapper
- **MCP changes** (`@prosdevlab/dev-agent-mcp`) → Usually bump wrapper if user-facing
- **Documentation only** → No package bumps needed

**Changeset Examples:**
```bash
# For CLI improvements that affect end users
echo '---
"@prosdevlab/dev-agent-cli": minor
"@prosdevlab/dev-agent": minor
---

Add TypeScript performance optimizations' > .changeset/feature-name.md

# For bug fixes
echo '---
"@prosdevlab/dev-agent-cli": patch
"@prosdevlab/dev-agent": patch
---

Fix MCP install error handling' > .changeset/fix-name.md
```

**Why the wrapper bump matters:**
- Users install `dev-agent` globally via npm
- The wrapper package needs to pull in the latest CLI changes
- Ensures `npm install -g dev-agent` gets all improvements

## 🎯 Commit Checkpoints (Know When to Commit)

**Principle:** Commit when you reach a "green state" at a logical boundary. Secure working progress before entering complexity.

### The Checkpoint Signals

Commit when you hit **any 2** of these signals:

#### 1. ✅ Green State
- All tests passing
- Build successful  
- No linter/TypeScript errors
- **This is non-negotiable** - never commit broken code

#### 2. 🎯 Logical Boundary
- Foundation complete (schemas, types, utils)
- Feature partially working (demo-able)
- Pattern proven (1+ examples working)
- Module/component finished

#### 3. ⚠️ Before Complexity
- About to refactor large file (>500 lines)
- About to change core architecture
- About to touch multiple interconnected systems
- About to migrate/upgrade major dependencies

#### 4. 📊 Demonstrable Value
- Can show progress in PR review
- Reviewers can understand what changed
- Rollback would still leave useful code
- "X/Y complete" milestones (e.g., "5/9 adapters migrated")

#### 5. 🧠 Context Limits
- Approaching 150K+ tokens in AI session
- Been working >2 hours on single task
- About to switch tasks/contexts
- End of work session

### Examples of Good Checkpoints

✅ **Foundation + Pattern Proven**
```bash
git commit -m "feat(mcp): add Zod validation to MCP adapters (5/9 complete)

- Create schemas for all 9 adapters (247 lines, 33 tests)
- Migrate 5 adapters (eliminates ~150 lines of validation)
- Pattern proven, remaining 4 follow same approach

All tests passing, build successful"
```

✅ **Before Complexity**
```bash
git commit -m "refactor(indexer): extract pure stat merging functions

- Extract 6 pure functions from 102-line method
- Add comprehensive tests (17 tests, 100% coverage)
- About to integrate into RepositoryIndexer class

Foundation secure before complex integration"
```

✅ **Logical Boundary**
```bash
git commit -m "feat(core): add stats metadata tracking

- Add StatsMetadata interface
- Implement in getStats() method
- Update CLI formatters to display metadata

Next: Incremental update merging (complex)"
```

### Anti-Patterns (Don't Commit)

❌ **Broken State**
```bash
# NEVER commit this:
git commit -m "WIP: refactoring adapters, tests failing"
git commit -m "fix: half-done, will finish tomorrow"
```

❌ **No Value**
```bash
# Don't commit just to save work:
git commit -m "save work"
git commit -m "checkpoint" # (what's done?)
git commit -m "WIP" # (what works?)
```

❌ **Debug Code**
```bash
# Don't commit with:
console.log('DEBUG: ...')
// TODO: fix this later
// HACK: temporary workaround
```

### Quick Checkpoint Checklist

Run before every commit:

```bash
# 1. Quality gates
pnpm build      # ✅ Builds without errors?
pnpm test       # ✅ All tests pass?
pnpm typecheck  # ✅ No TypeScript errors?

# 2. Review changes
git diff --stat # 📊 Reasonable change size?
git status      # 🔍 All intended files staged?

# 3. If all pass → commit!
git add -A
git commit -m "feat(scope): description..."
```

### Why This Matters

**For Teams:**
- Reduces risk of losing working code
- Makes code review easier (incremental progress)
- Git bisect finds bugs faster
- Enables parallel work (others can pull partial features)

**For AI Collaboration:**
- Context windows reset - commits are checkpoints
- Recovery is instant (just read git log)
- TODOs + commits = perfect state reconstruction
- Enables long-running refactorings (>1 session)

**For You:**
- Sleep better (work is secured)
- Switch contexts freely (commit before leaving)
- Experiment safely (can always rollback)
- Build confidence (see progress accumulate)

### Real Example: Zod Migration

**Checkpoint Decision:** After migrating 5/9 adapters
- ✅ Green: All tests passing, build successful
- ✅ Logical boundary: Foundation complete, pattern proven
- ✅ Before complexity: Next 4 adapters are 690-724 lines each
- ✅ Demonstrable: "5/9 complete, 150 lines eliminated"
- ✅ Context: At 115K tokens, approaching limit

**Result:** Committed working state. If next adapters break, we can rollback to this checkpoint.

## PR Description Format

### Principles

**Keep it concise and meaningful** - Context is important, but excessive noise makes PRs harder to parse. Focus on essential information that helps reviewers and provides future reference.

### Structure

```markdown
## Summary
1-2 sentence overview of what this PR does and why.

## Problem (if fix)
Brief description of the bug/issue being fixed.

## Solution
- Key change 1
- Key change 2
- Key change 3

## Usage (if new feature)
```bash
# Example command or code snippet
```

## Testing
- ✅ X tests passing (Y new tests)
- ✅ Verified on: specific scenario/repository
- ⚠️ Known limitations (if any)

## Changes
- N commits: brief description of commit types
- Packages affected: list relevant packages
```

### Good Example

```markdown
## Summary
Fixes ENOBUFS error when indexing repositories with many GitHub issues/PRs.

## Problem
\`dev index\` would fail with \`ENOBUFS\` on repositories with extensive GitHub 
activity due to buffer overflow (default 1MB buffer, fetching 1000+ items).

## Solution
- Increased maxBuffer: 1MB → 50MB for issue/PR fetching
- Lowered default limit: 1000 → 500 items per type
- Added \`--gh-limit <number>\` CLI flag for customization
- Improved error messages with actionable suggestions

## Usage
\`\`\`bash
dev index                    # Default (500 items)
dev index --gh-limit 200     # Large repos
dev index --gh-limit 100     # Very active repos
\`\`\`

## Testing
- ✅ All 1100+ tests passing
- ✅ 23 new fetcher utility tests
- ✅ Verified on 6,989 file repo with 1,000 issues/PRs

## Changes
- 6 commits: fix implementation, tests, documentation, changeset, website
- Patches: \`@prosdevlab/dev-agent\`, \`@prosdevlab/dev-agent-cli\`, \`@prosdevlab/dev-agent-subagents\`
```

### What to Exclude

**Don't include:**
- ❌ Verbose change logs (commits already document this)
- ❌ Line-by-line code explanations
- ❌ Coverage tables (CI provides this)
- ❌ Full test lists (test files document this)
- ❌ Obvious information that's in the code

**Instead:**
- ✅ Focus on the "why" and key decisions
- ✅ Usage examples for new features
- ✅ Verification details for bug fixes
- ✅ Brief overview of what changed

## Testing Standards

### Coverage Goals
- **Statement Coverage**: 85%+ (aim for 90%+)
- **Branch Coverage**: 60%+ (aim for 80%+)
- **Function Coverage**: 100%
- **Line Coverage**: 85%+

### Test Organization

```typescript
describe('ComponentName', () => {
  // Setup
  beforeAll(async () => {
    // Initialize shared resources
  });

  afterAll(async () => {
    // Cleanup
  });

  // Happy path tests
  it('should do main thing', () => {});
  it('should handle common case', () => {});

  // Edge cases
  it('should handle empty input', () => {});
  it('should handle large input', () => {});

  // Error cases
  it('should throw on invalid input', () => {});
  it('should handle error gracefully', () => {});
});

describe('ComponentName - Advanced', () => {
  // Complex scenarios
  it('should handle concurrent operations', () => {});
  it('should handle cleanup', () => {});
});
```

### What to Test

**Must Test:**
- ✅ Happy paths (normal usage)
- ✅ Edge cases (empty, null, boundaries)
- ✅ Error handling
- ✅ Public API methods
- ✅ Integration points

**Don't Need to Test:**
