## 0.6.1

### Patch Changes

- d3d2126: feat(mcp): refactor dev_inspect and optimize pattern analysis

  **API Simplification:**

  - `dev_inspect` simplified to single-purpose tool (action parameter streamlined)
  - Previously: `dev_inspect({ action: "compare", query: "file.ts" })`
  - Now: `dev_inspect({ query: "file.ts" })`
  - Existing usage continues to work with dynamic MCP schema discovery

  **Major Features:**

  - Created `PatternAnalysisService` with 5 pattern extractors:
    - Import style (ESM, CJS, mixed, unknown)
    - Error handling (throw, result, callback, unknown)
    - Type coverage (full, partial, none)
    - Testing (co-located test files)
    - File size (lines vs similar files)
  - Batch scanning optimization (5-10x faster: 500-1000ms vs 2-3 seconds)
  - Embedding-based similarity search (no more false matches)
  - Extension filtering (`.ts` only compares with `.ts`)
  - Comprehensive pattern analysis (finds similar files + analyzes patterns)

  **Performance:**

  - One ts-morph initialization vs 6 separate scans
  - Batch scan all files in one pass
  - `searchByDocumentId()` for embedding-based similarity
  - Pattern analysis: 500-1000ms (down from 2-3 seconds)

  **Bug Fixes:**

  - Fixed `findSimilar` to use document embeddings instead of file paths
  - Fixed `--force` flag to properly clear old vector data
  - Fixed race condition in LanceDB table creation
  - Removed `outputSchema` from all 9 MCP adapters (Cursor/Claude compatibility)

  **New Features:**

  - Test utilities in `@prosdevlab/dev-agent-core/utils`:
    - `isTestFile()` — Check if file is a test file
    - `findTestFile()` — Find co-located test files
  - Vector store `clear()` method
  - Vector store `searchByDocumentId()` method
  - Comprehensive pattern comparison with statistical analysis

  **Migration Guide:**

  ```typescript
  // Before (v0.8.4)
  dev_inspect({ action: "compare", query: "src/auth.ts" });
  dev_inspect({ action: "validate", query: "src/auth.ts" });

  // After (v0.8.5) - Streamlined!
  dev_inspect({ query: "src/auth.ts" });
  ```

  The tool now automatically finds similar files AND performs pattern analysis. No migration needed - MCP tools discover the new schema dynamically.

  **Re-index Recommended:**

  ```bash
  dev index . --force
  ```

  This clears old data and rebuilds with improved embedding-based search.

  **Documentation:**

  - Complete rewrite of dev-inspect.mdx
  - Updated README.md with pattern categories
  - Updated CLAUDE.md with new descriptions
  - Added v0.8.5 changelog entry to website
  - Migration guide from dev_explore

  **Tests:**

  - All 1100+ tests passing
  - Added 10 new test-utils tests
  - Pattern analysis service fully tested
  - Integration tests for InspectAdapter

- Updated dependencies [d3d2126]
  - @prosdevlab/dev-agent-core@0.9.3
  - @prosdevlab/dev-agent-mcp@0.5.4
  - @prosdevlab/dev-agent-subagents@0.5.4

## 0.6.0

### Minor Changes

- 8b4972a: Remove git analytics commands to refocus on semantic value

  **BREAKING CHANGES:**

  - Remove `dev owners` command - use `git log` or GitHub contributors instead
  - Remove `dev activity` command - use `git log --since` for activity analysis

  **What's Changed:**

  - Removed 891 lines from `dev owners` command
  - Removed 175 lines from `dev activity` command
  - Cleaned up dead code in `change-frequency.ts` (calculateFileAuthorContributions)
  - Simplified metrics collection to focus on code structure introspection

  **What's Kept:**

  - `code_metadata` table for debugging/introspection of indexed code
  - `calculateChangeFrequency` for `dev_map` MCP tool (shows commit activity in codebase structure)

  **Why:**

  Dev-agent's unique value is semantic search (embeddings + AST), not git analytics which GitHub/git already provide. This change reduces complexity by ~1,200 lines and refocuses on MCP tools for AI context.

  **Migration:**

  For contributor/ownership analytics, use:

  - `git log --format="%ae" <path> | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn` for ownership
  - `git log --since="1 month" --name-only | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn` for activity
  - GitHub's Contributors page for visualization

## 0.5.1

### Patch Changes

- f20406e: # Visual Formatting & GitHub Stats Improvements

  ## Visual Enhancements ✨

  ### Tree Branches & File Icons

  All CLI outputs now use consistent tree-based formatting with file icons:

  **`dev map` hot paths:**

  ```
  ## Hot Paths (most referenced)
    ├─ 📘 **typescript.ts** • 307 refs
       /packages/core/src/scanner
    ├─ 📘 **index.ts** • 251 refs
       /packages/core/src/indexer
    └─ 📘 **go.ts** • 152 refs
       /packages/core/src/scanner
  ```

  **`dev activity` output:**

  ```
  ├─ 📘 packages/mcp-server/bin/dev-agent-mcp.ts
  │     34 commits • 1 👤 • Last: today
  │
  ├─ 📘 packages/core/src/indexer/index.ts
  │     32 commits • 1 👤 • Last: today
  ```

  ### Shared Icon Utility

  Extracted `getFileIcon()` to `@prosdevlab/dev-agent-core/utils` for reuse across packages.

  ## GitHub Stats Fix 🐛

  Fixed confusing issue/PR state display:

  **Before:**

  ```
  Issues: 68 total (14 open, 55 closed)
  Pull Requests: 97 total (14 open, 96 merged)  ❌ Wrong!
  ```

  **After:**

  ```
  Issues: 68 total (14 open, 54 closed)
  Pull Requests: 97 total (0 open, 96 merged)   ✅ Correct!
  ```

  - Added separate state tracking: `issuesByState`, `prsByState`
  - GitHub indexer now tracks issue and PR states independently
  - Stats display now shows accurate per-type counts

  ## Progress Display Improvements 📊

  ### Detailed Progress with Rates

  All indexing commands now show detailed progress:

  ```
  Scanning Repository: 1,234/4,567 files (27%, 45 files/sec)
  Embedding Vectors: 856/2,549 documents (34%, 122 docs/sec)
  ```

  Applied to:

  - `dev index` - scanning & embedding progress
  - `dev update` - changed files & embedding progress
  - `dev git index` - commit embedding progress
  - `dev github index` - document embedding progress

  ### Update Plan Display

  `dev update` now shows what will change before starting:

  ```
  Update plan:
    • Changed: 3 files
    • Added: 1 file
    • Deleted: 0 files
  ```

  ### Code Quality

  - Refactored progress logic into `ProgressRenderer.updateSectionWithRate()`
  - Reduced ~40 lines of duplicated code
  - Fixed NaN display (now shows "Discovering files..." initially)

  ## Bug Fixes 🐛

  - **`dev owners`**: Fixed "No ownership data" error when run from subdirectories
  - **Progress Display**: Fixed NaN showing during initial file discovery phase
  - **`dev update`**: Removed duplicate checkmark in success message

  ## Breaking Changes

  None - all changes are backward compatible. Old GitHub state files will fall back to aggregate counts gracefully.

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- d23d1a9: Massive indexing performance and UX improvements

  **Performance Optimizations (184% faster):**

  - **63x faster metadata collection**: Eliminated 863 individual git calls by using single batched git command
  - **Removed storage size calculation**: Deferred to on-demand in `dev stats` (saves 1-3s)
  - **Simplified ownership tracking**: Author contributions now calculated on-demand in `dev owners` (1s), removed SQLite pre-indexing overhead
  - **Total speedup**: Indexing now completes in ~33s vs ~95s (61s improvement!)

  **Architecture Simplifications:**

  - Removed `file_authors` SQLite table (on-demand is fast enough)
  - Removed `appendFileAuthors()` and `getFileAuthors()` from MetricsStore
  - Removed `authorContributions` from IndexUpdatedEvent
  - Cleaner separation: metrics for analytics, ownership for developer insights

  **UX Improvements (no more silent gaps):**

  - **Section-based progress display**: Clean, informative output inspired by Homebrew/Cargo
  - **Applied to 4 commands**: `dev index`, `dev update`, `dev git index`, `dev github index`
  - **Live progress updates**: Shows current progress for each phase (scanning, embedding, git, GitHub)
  - **Clean indexing plan**: Removed INFO timestamps from plan display
  - **Helpful next steps**: Suggests relevant commands after indexing completes
  - **More frequent scanner progress**: Logs every 2 batches OR every 10 seconds (was every 50 files)
  - **Slow file detection**: Debug logs for files/batches taking >5s to process
  - **Cleaner completion summary**: Removed storage size from index output (shown in `dev stats` instead)
  - **Continuous feedback**: Maximum 1-second gaps between progress updates
  - **Context-aware `dev owners` command**: Adapts output based on git status and current directory
    - **Changed files mode**: Shows ownership of uncommitted changes with real-time git log analysis
    - **Root directory mode**: High-level overview of top areas (packages/cli/, packages/core/)
    - **Subdirectory mode**: Detailed expertise for specific area
    - **Smart ownership display**: Asymmetric icons that only flag exceptions (⚠️ for others' files, 🆕 for new files)
    - **Last touched timestamps**: Shows when files were last modified (catches stale code and active development)
    - **Recent activity detection**: Warns when others recently touched your files (prevents conflicts)
    - **Suggested reviewers**: Automatically identifies who to loop in for code reviews
    - **Visual hierarchy**: Tree branches (├─, └─) and emojis (📝, 📁, 👤) for better readability
    - **Activity-focused**: Sorted by last active, not file count (no more leaderboard vibes)
    - **Git root detection**: Works from any subdirectory within the repository
  - **Better developer grouping**: `dev owners` now groups by GitHub handle instead of email (merges multiple emails for same developer)
  - **Graceful degradation**: Verbose mode and non-TTY environments show traditional log output

  **Technical Details:**

  - Added `log-update` dependency for smooth single-line progress updates
  - New `ProgressRenderer` class for section-based progress display
  - Optimized `buildCodeMetadata()` to derive change frequency from author contributions instead of making separate git calls
  - Scanner now tracks time since last log and ensures updates every 10s
  - Storage size calculation moved from index-time to query-time (lazy evaluation)
  - TTY detection for graceful fallback in CI/CD environments

## 0.1.11

### Patch Changes

- d6e5e6f: Fix ENOBUFS error during GitHub issues/PRs indexing for large repositories

  **Problem:** When indexing repositories with many GitHub issues/PRs (especially with large issue bodies), the `dev index` command would fail with `ENOBUFS` (No buffer space available) error.

  **Solution:**

  - Increased execSync maxBuffer from default 1MB to 50MB for issue/PR fetching
  - Reduced default fetch limit from 1000 to 500 items to prevent buffer overflow
  - Added `--gh-limit` CLI flag to allow users to customize the limit
  - Improved error messages to guide users when buffer issues occur

  **Changes:**

  - `fetchIssues()` and `fetchPullRequests()` now use 50MB maxBuffer
  - Default limit changed from 1000 to 500 (per type: issues and PRs)
  - Added `--gh-limit <number>` flag to `dev index` command
  - Better error handling with helpful suggestions (use `--gh-limit 100` for very large repos)
  - Comprehensive test coverage (23 new tests for fetcher utilities)

  **Usage:**

  ```bash
  # Default (works for most repos)
  dev index

  # For large repos (200+ issues/PRs)
  dev index --gh-limit 200

  # For very active repos (500+ issues/PRs)
  dev index --gh-limit 100
  ```

  **Testing:** All 1100+ tests passing. Verified on lytics-ui repository (6989 files, 1000 issues/PRs indexed successfully).

  ### Features

  - **Index size reporting**: `dev index` now calculates and displays actual storage size after indexing (e.g., "Storage size: 2.5 MB"). Previously showed 0.

  ### Internal

  - Moved `getDirectorySize` and `formatBytes` utilities to shared `file.ts` module
  - Added comprehensive tests for size calculation and formatting

## 0.1.5

### Patch Changes

- 4b55a04: Fix MCP server to include all 9 adapters and improve tool descriptions for better AI tool adoption

  **Bug Fix:**

  - CLI's `mcp start` command now registers all 9 adapters (was missing HealthAdapter, RefsAdapter, MapAdapter, HistoryAdapter)
  - Updated tool list in CLI output and install messages to show all 9 tools

  **Tool Description Improvements:**

  - `dev_search`: Added "USE THIS FIRST" trigger, comparison to grep for conceptual queries
  - `dev_map`: Clarified it shows component counts and exports, better than list_dir
  - `dev_explore`: Clarified workflow - use after dev_search for "similar" and "relationships" actions
  - `dev_refs`: Added guidance to use for specific symbols, use dev_search for conceptual queries
  - `dev_history`: Added "WHY" trigger, clarified semantic search over commits
  - `dev_plan`: Emphasized "ALL context in one call" value prop for GitHub issues
  - `dev_gh`: Clarified semantic search by meaning, not just keywords

  These description improvements help AI tools (Claude, Cursor) choose the right dev-agent tool for each task.

- Updated dependencies [4b55a04]
  - @prosdevlab/dev-agent-mcp@0.4.1

## 0.1.4

### Patch Changes

- 573ad3a: feat: unified indexing and CLI improvements

  **`dev index .`** now indexes everything in one command:

  - Code (always)
  - Git history (if in a git repo)
  - GitHub issues/PRs (if gh CLI installed)

  Shows an upfront "indexing plan" with prerequisites check.
  Use `--no-git` or `--no-github` to skip specific indexers.

  **New `dev git` commands:**

  - `dev git index` - index git history separately
  - `dev git search <query>` - semantic search over commits
  - `dev git stats` - show indexed commit count

  **Fix:** `dev --version` now correctly displays installed version (injected at build time).
