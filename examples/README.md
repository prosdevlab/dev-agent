# Dev-Agent Examples

Real-world usage patterns for dev-agent MCP tools.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install dev-agent
npm install -g dev-agent

# Index your repository (code, git history, GitHub)
cd /path/to/your/project
dev index

# Install MCP for Cursor
dev mcp install --cursor

# Restart Cursor - tools are now available!
```

## Tool Examples

### `dev_search` - Semantic Code Search

Find code by meaning, not exact text:

```
# Find authentication logic
dev_search: "user authentication and login flow"

# Find error handling patterns
dev_search: "how errors are caught and handled"

# Find API endpoints
dev_search: "REST API route handlers"
```

**With options:**
```
dev_search:
  query: "database connection pooling"
  limit: 5
  scoreThreshold: 0.4
  tokenBudget: 2000
```

**Output includes:**
- Code snippets (up to 50 lines)
- Import statements
- File locations
- Relevance scores

---

### `dev_refs` - Relationship Queries

Understand code dependencies:

```
# What calls this function?
dev_refs:
  name: "validateUser"
  direction: "callers"

# What does this function call?
dev_refs:
  name: "processPayment"
  direction: "callees"

# Both directions
dev_refs:
  name: "AuthService"
  direction: "both"
```

**Use cases:**
- Impact analysis before refactoring
- Understanding code flow
- Finding entry points

---

### `dev_map` - Codebase Overview

Get a high-level view of the codebase:

```
# Basic map (depth 2)
dev_map

# Deeper exploration
dev_map:
  depth: 4

# Focus on specific directory
dev_map:
  focus: "src/api"
  depth: 3

# Include hot paths (most referenced files)
dev_map:
  includeHotPaths: true
  smartDepth: true

# Show change frequency (v0.4+)
dev_map:
  includeChangeFrequency: true
```

**Output shows:**
- Directory structure
- Component counts per directory
- Exported symbols with signatures
- Hot paths (frequently referenced files)
- Change frequency indicators (🔥 hot, ✏️ active, 📝 recent)

---

### `dev_history` - Git History Search ✨ v0.4

Semantic search over git commits:

```
# Search commits by meaning
dev_history:
  query: "authentication token fix"

# Get file history
dev_history:
  mode: "file"
  file: "src/auth/middleware.ts"

# Filter by author
dev_history:
  query: "performance optimization"
  author: "alice"

# Recent commits only
dev_history:
  query: "bug fix"
  since: "30 days ago"
```

**Output shows:**
- Commits with relevance scores
- Author and date
- Changed files
- Issue/PR references extracted from messages

---

### `dev_plan` - Context Assembly

Get rich context for implementing a GitHub issue:

```
# Basic context
dev_plan:
  issue: 42

# Full context package (v0.4+)
dev_plan:
  issue: 42
  includeCode: true
  includeHistory: true
  includePatterns: true
```

**Returns:**
- Issue details (title, body, labels, comments)
- Relevant code snippets from semantic search
- **Related commits** from git history (v0.4+)
- Codebase patterns (test conventions, etc.)
- Related issues/PRs

---

### `dev_gh` - GitHub Search

Search issues and PRs semantically:

```
# Search issues
dev_gh:
  action: "search"
  query: "authentication bugs"

# Get specific issue
dev_gh:
  action: "get"
  number: 42
```

**First, index GitHub:**
```bash
dev github index
```

---

### `dev_inspect` - File Analysis

Inspect files and compare implementations:

```
# Compare similar implementations
dev_inspect:
  action: "compare"
  query: "src/utils/retry.ts"

# Validate pattern consistency (coming soon)
dev_inspect:
  action: "validate"
  query: "src/hooks/useAuth.ts"
```

---

### `dev_status` - Repository Status

Check indexing status:

```
dev_status

# Specific section
dev_status:
  section: "indexes"
```

---

### `dev_health` - Health Check

Diagnose issues:

```
dev_health

# Verbose output
dev_health:
  verbose: true
```

---

## Workflow Examples

### Starting a New Feature

1. **Understand the codebase:**
   ```
   dev_map: { depth: 3, includeHotPaths: true }
   ```

2. **Find related code:**
   ```
   dev_search: "similar feature implementation"
   ```

3. **Check what calls the area you'll modify:**
   ```
   dev_refs: { name: "TargetModule", direction: "callers" }
   ```

### Bug Investigation

1. **Search for the bug area:**
   ```
   dev_search: "error message from bug report"
   ```

2. **Trace the code path:**
   ```
   dev_refs: { name: "suspectFunction", direction: "callees" }
   ```

3. **Find related commits:**
   ```
   dev_history: { query: "similar bug fix" }
   ```

4. **Find similar issues:**
   ```
   dev_gh: { action: "search", query: "similar error" }
   ```

### Implementing a GitHub Issue

1. **Get full context:**
   ```
   dev_plan: { issue: 123 }
   ```

2. **Search for relevant patterns:**
   ```
   dev_search: { query: "feature type from issue" }
   ```

### Code Review Prep

1. **Understand the change area:**
   ```
   dev_map: { focus: "path/to/changed/dir", includeChangeFrequency: true }
   ```

2. **Check file history:**
   ```
   dev_history: { mode: "file", file: "path/to/changed/file.ts" }
   ```

3. **Check impact:**
   ```
   dev_refs: { name: "changedFunction", direction: "callers" }
   ```

## Tips

### Search Quality

- **Use natural language** - "how users are authenticated" not "authUser function"
- **Describe behavior** - "retry logic with exponential backoff"
- **Lower threshold for exploration** - `scoreThreshold: 0.3`

### Token Management

- Use `tokenBudget` to control output size
- `compact` format for quick lookups
- `verbose` format for deep dives

### Keeping Index Fresh

```bash
# After major changes
dev index

# After new issues/PRs
dev github index

# Check health
dev_health
```

---

## CLI Examples

```bash
# Index everything
dev index

# Search code
dev search "authentication" --limit 5 --threshold 0.4

# Search git history
dev git search "authentication fix"

# Check stats
dev stats

# Explore patterns
dev explore pattern "error handling"

# Find similar code
dev explore similar src/utils/retry.ts
```

---

## Integration Patterns

### With Cursor

Cursor automatically detects workspace changes. Just:
1. `dev mcp install --cursor`
2. Restart Cursor
3. Use tools in chat

### With Claude Code

```bash
dev mcp install
# Tools available immediately
```

### In Scripts

```bash
# JSON output for scripting
dev search "coordinator" --json | jq '.[].metadata.path'

# Check if indexed
dev stats --json | jq '.filesIndexed'
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### "No results found"

```bash
# Check if indexed
dev stats

# Re-index
dev index
```

### "Repository not indexed"

```bash
dev index
dev mcp install --cursor
# Restart Cursor
```

### Slow responses

- Reduce `limit`
- Use `compact` format
- Check `dev_health`
